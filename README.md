# Quant-Bottle Research

Welcome to Quant-Bottle!

I am an eager learner in the field of quantitative finance, mainly focus in quantitative investment methods, portfolio management, derivative strategies and risk hedging, blockchains, machine learning and deep learning projects.

This is the place where I post some of my independent analysis results, including logs, public data and source codes.

It would be so great if my codes and analysis can also help some other students in the same field.

## Log 1. Factor Models

Factor models are among the most widely used models by investors. Well known CAPM and Fama/French Factor Models, and so many recent reserach papers suggest a unavoidable trade-off between risks and returns. In this section, I will walk through these basic models, and try to build some portfolios with explainable and perhaps predictable factors, and hedge them against tradable risk premium benchmarks, trying to earn abnormal significant yields.

The larger dataset that contain all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT (last updated 11/10/2017) are  downloadable from: https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs. Thanks so much for the author to make a huge set of public stocks dataset available.
