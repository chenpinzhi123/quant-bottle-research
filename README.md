# Quant-Bottle Research

Welcome to Quant-Bottle!

I am an eager learner in the field of quantitative finance, mainly focus in quantitative investment methods, portfolio management, derivative strategies and risk hedging, blockchains, machine learning and deep learning projects.

This is the place where I post some of my independent analysis results, including logs, public data and source codes.

It would be so great if my codes and analysis can also help some other students in the same field.
